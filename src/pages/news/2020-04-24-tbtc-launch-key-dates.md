tBTC will begin moving toward full mainnet launch over the coming weeks. Launch will occur over a series of milestones starting April 24th.

**On Friday, April 24th**, the MakerDAO community will vote to finalize their first ETHBTC feed, deployed specifically for tBTC, and agree to whitelist the future tBTC contract.

**On Monday, April 27th**, the team will deploy the KEEP token contract and all custodial and staking contracts. Custody and staking will be managed by groups including Coinbase and Anchorage, who will begin their next phase of diligence on mainnet. Tokens will be distributed to the team and purchasers following their vesting agreements, enforced on chain.

**On Monday, May 4th**, the Keep random beacon, which selects tBTC signers, and token dashboard will be deployed. Once 64 operators have begun staking, the genesis relay entry of the random beacon will be generated.

**On Monday, May 11th**, tBTC will launch on mainnet using MakerDAOâ€™s ETHBTC feed.At launch, the dApp will limit deposits to small lot sizes, growing over the following weeks. DEXs, DeFi integrations, and anyone calling contracts directly will be able to mint freely immediately.

Finally, on June 8th anyone will be able to become a tBTC signer in the KEEP stakedrop. **[RSVP here to the live stakedrop event](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/keep-stakedrop---live/register).**
