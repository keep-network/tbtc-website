tBTC, which enables Bitcoin holders to act on the Ethereum blockchain, will add an integration with the [Celo](https://celo.org/) Platform, an open blockchain platform designed to make financial tools accessible to people with a mobile phone.

tBTC allows people to exchange BTC for tBTC, an ERC-20 token, at a rate of 1:1. Each tBTC token is fully backed and matched by at least 1 BTC held in reserve. tBTC is trustless, using a random beacon to select “signers” who have responsibility for the deposited BTC. tBTC can be converted to BTC, and vice-versa with no intermediary needed to sign off.
