Starting today, you can mint tBTC on Arbitrum directly with the new native minting portal.

This launch from Threshold DAO gives tBTC users seamless access to the leading Ethereum L2. Now, Bitcoin holders can access Arbitrum’s $2.5B DeFi ecosystem to earn yield, borrow against their BTC, or trade perps.

The minting portal should also improve the trading experience by bringing improved liquidity to the Arbitrum ecosystem for tBTC users.

The launch includes a tBTC Native Minting Dapp built for Arbitrum users, a powerful off-chain relayer, a tBTC SDK extension for Arbitrum ecosystem builders, and a long-term tBTC on Arbitrum rewards program. More info can be found at the [Threshold Blog](https://blog.threshold.network/), and you can check out the [tBTC SDK documentation](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/tbtc-v2/tbtc-sdk) for more information on how to start building.

tBTC offers users a trust-minimzed way to bring their Bitcoin holdings into the EVM and Solana ecosystems, effectively giving their Bitcoin wheels and making it a productive asset.

The total count of tBTC holders has jumped significantly in recent months, signaling that the market is further embracing decentralized alternatives in the tokenized Bitcoin market.

Outstanding supply currently stands at [~3,400 tBTC](https://dune.com/threshold/tbtc), with a majority on Ethereum L1. Now, users can enjoy all the same benefits that tBTC offers directly on Arbitrum.

The Threshold DAO also put together some incentive buckets thanks to the Arbitrum grants program:

* 200k ARB for ongoing liquidity pool incentives
* 20k ARB for tBTC lending protocol incentives
* 50k ARB for long-term tBTC on Arbitrum holders
