tBTC is now fully open-sourced, including the code for signers’ groups.

The [Keep ECDSA](https://github.com/keep-network/keep-ecdsa), which underlies the signers’ groups, is now publicly available on GitHub. This includes the on- and off-chain pieces of ECDSA keeps and Bonded ECDSA keeps for the Keep network, which enable the creation and functioning of signers’ groups on tBTC.

tBTC is committed to open-sourcing as the best standard for transparency and security in DeFi.This open-sourcing makes tBTC the first and only BTC bridge that allows for permissionless signing.
