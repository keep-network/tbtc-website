A new library, [`tbtc.js`](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc.js), is live on
GitHub, representing the easiest, safest way to integrate Bitcoin in your
Ethereum dApp.

`tbtc.js` makes it easy for developers to directly integrate Bitcoin into their
dApps. That means products like [Compound](https://compound.finance),
[dydx](https://dydx.exchange/), and [Aave](https://aave.com) can build seamless
experiences for Bitcoin holders to get involved in the DeFi ecosystem.

The library takes the pain out of building a cross-chain dApp, interacting with
the Bitcoin network through an Electrum client and Ethereum through a standard
Web3 provider.

With `tbtc.js`, you can

-> [Accept Bitcoin deposits in your dApp](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc.js#creating-and-funding-a-deposit)

->  Mint tBTC

->  Transfer and trade tBTC as you would any other ERC-20 token

-> [Redeem users' tBTC for Bitcoin](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc.js#redeeming-a-deposit)

... all without taking custody or changing your tech stack.

Take the library for a spin on [GitHub](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc.js)!
