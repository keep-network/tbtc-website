[Gemini](https://gemini.com/), the global cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, has added custody support for tBTC. An open-source project by [Keep](https://keep.network/), [Summa](https://summa.one/), and the [Cross-Chain Group](https://crosschain.group/), tBTC lets Bitcoin holders safely act on the Ethereum blockchain so they can earn using DeFi.

tBTC allows people to exchange BTC for tBTC, an ERC-20 token, at a rate of 1:1. Each tBTC token is fully backed and matched by at least 1 BTC held in reserve. tBTC is trustless, using a random beacon to select “signers” who have responsibility for the deposited BTC. tBTC can be converted to BTC, and vice-versa with no intermediary needed to sign off.

tBTC users can now access [Gemini Custody](https://gemini.com/custody) to store and manage their tBTC tokens [here](https://gemini.com/prices/tbtc).
