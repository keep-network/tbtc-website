Developers can build on tBTC. There are several resources to help devs use tBTC infrastructure to bring Bitcoin to Ethereum. Get started with the following resources:

- [tBTC JavaScript SDK documentation](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/tbtc-v2/tbtc-sdk)
- The Sepolia-connected [Threshold tBTC dApp](https://dashboard.test.threshold.network)
- The [tBTC smart contracts](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2)
- The [tBTC smart contracts API documentation](https://docs.threshold.network/app-development/tbtc-v2/tbtc-contracts-api/tbtc-v2-api)
- The [tBTC detailed system architecture](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc-v2/tree/main/docs/README.adoc)

Developers are already building on tBTC using the tools above, and you can connect with the
developer community on the [Threshold Discord server](https://chat.threshold.network).
