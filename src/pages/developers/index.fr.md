- [How to Integrate TBTC into Your Defi Dapp](/developers/how-to-integrate-tbtc-into-your-defi-dapp)
- The Ropsten-connected [tBTC dApp](https://dapp.test.tbtc.network/)
- [tBTC smart contracts](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc)
- [tbtc.js](https://github.com/keep-network/tbtc.js)
- [The technical specification](http://docs.keep.network/tbtc/)
- [The Solidity API documentation](http://docs.keep.network/tbtc/solidity/)

Developers are already building on tBTC using the tools above.
