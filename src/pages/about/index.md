      Threshold Network is a set of protocols and the node operators that back
      them to offer a full suite of decentralized threshold cryptography
      services. Threshold cryptography protects data by distributing operations
      across a network of independent nodes. This simple idea increases security
      and availability and reduces reliance on trusted parties. It was formed by
      the first ever on-chain merger between the Keep and NuCypher networks.

      Keep was a privacy layer for Ethereum created by Thesis. A “keep” is an
      off-chain container for private data. Keeps help contracts harness the
      full power of the public blockchain — enabling deep interactivity with
      private data. The Keep network, powered by KEEP tokens, handled
      custodianship for tBTC v1. It has been operationally  superseded by the
      Threshold Network for tBTC v2, an upgraded, more scalable, and more
      efficient version of tBTC built by Thesis and operated by Threshold since
      2022.
