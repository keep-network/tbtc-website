      Threshold Network is a set of protocols and the node operators that back
      them to offer a full suite of decentralized threshold cryptography
      services. Threshold cryptography protects data by distributing operations
      across a network of independent nodes. This simple idea increases security
      and availability and reduces reliance on trusted parties. It was formed by
      the first ever on-chain merger between the Keep and NuCypher networks.

      Keep was a privacy layer for Ethereum. A “keep” is an off-chain container
      for private data. Keeps help contracts harness the full power of the
      public blockchain — enabling deep interactivity with private data. The
      Keep network, powered by KEEP tokens, handled custodianship for tBTC v1.
      It has been superseded by the Threshold Network for tBTC v2, an upgraded,
      more scalable, and more efficient version of tBTC operated by Threshold
      since 2022.
