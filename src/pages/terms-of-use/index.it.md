## Acceptance of the Terms of Use

These terms of use are entered into by and between You and Keep SECZ, a Cayman Islands special economic zone company ("**Company**", "**we**" or "**us**"). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these "**Terms of Use**"), govern your access to and use of the network located at [tbtc.network](https://tbtc.network/) as well as any content, functionality, smart contracts, distributed applications ("Dapps") and services offered on or through the tBTC network (collectively, the "**Network**"). The Network is currently administered by the Company using open source protocols; however, we intend over time for the Network and the network protocol to become decentralized and governed entirely by the community of its users in whatever manner they determine.

Please read the Terms of Use carefully before you start to use the Network. **By using the Network or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Use and our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), incorporated herein by reference.** If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Use or the [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), you must not access or use the Network.

This Network is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older who are not residents of countries named on the [US Department of the Treasury Sanctions list](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx) or named on the Office of Foreign Asset Control's list of [Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) ("SDN List"). If the user is an organization, you affirm you have the right, power and authority to enter into this agreement on behalf of the organization and bind the organization to its terms. If you do not agree to the terms of this agreement, you must not use the Network or any of our services. By using this Network, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with the Company and meet all of the foregoing eligibility requirements. You represent that you are legally permitted to use the Network in your jurisdiction including owning Digital Assets and interacting with the Network in any way.If you do not meet all of these requirements, you must not access or use the Network. Without limiting the foregoing, by using the Network, you acknowledge and understand that laws regarding financial instruments, which sometimes include cryptographic tokens, also known as "**Digital Assets**", and decentralized finance may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is your obligation alone to ensure that you fully comply with any law, regulation or directive, relevant to your jurisdiction with regard to the use of the Network. You further represent and warrant that you will not use the Network or access its smart contract functionality if the laws of your country of residency or establishment prohibit you from doing so in accordance with this agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the ability to access the Network does not necessarily mean that the Network, or your activities through it, are legal under the laws, regulations or directives relevant to your jurisdiction. All of the Network or the services made available through the Network may not be available to all users, and we reserve the right to assess or reassess at any time your eligibility to use all or part of our Network. The availability of the Network does not constitute, and may not be used for the purposes of, an offer or solicitation to anyone in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized, or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation. By accessing or using the Network, you explicitly agree that the smart contracts built into the Dapps that comprise the Network are legally binding and enforceable upon you and the contract counterparty.

## Changes to the Terms of Use

We, or in the future, a decentralized governing body, may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Network thereafter. However, any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set forth in Governing Law and Jurisdiction will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice on or prior to the date the change is posted on the Network.

Your continued use of the Network following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page each time you access this Network so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

## Accessing the Network and Account Security

To access the Network or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide an Ethereum wallet address (a "**Wallet**"). It is your sole responsibility to maintain the security of your Wallet. If you lose access to your Wallet, a private key, password, or other method of securing your Wallet, any funds may be irretrievable, and we will be unable to assist you in any way. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against us, our affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to your use of any Wallet software, associated loss of funds, transaction failures, or any other defects that arise in the course of your use of your Wallet, including any losses that may obtain as a result of any failure in smart contracts made available on the Network. By using the Network, you agree to be fully, independently and personally liable for each transaction made on the Network by you, and you must make sure that you are the only person with access to your Wallet at all times. You hereby accept responsibility for any activity transacted on the Network through your Wallet.

We will use commercially reasonable technical and physical safeguards to make the Network securely available to its users. However, given the inherent risk of transmitting information over the internet and the relatively new and untested nature of decentralized finance, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Network is unavailable at any time or for any period. You alone are responsible for evaluating any code provided by or used on the Network. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Network, or the entire Network, to users. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Network and ensuring that all persons who access the Network through your internet connection are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.

It is a condition of your use of the Network that all the information you provide on the Network is correct, current and complete. You agree that all information you provide to this Network or otherwise, including but not limited to through the use of any interactive features on the Network, is governed by our [_Privacy Policy_](https://tbtc.network/privacy-policy), and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy.

## Fees

Some services on the Network involve the use of blockchains, including the Ethereum blockchain, which may require that you pay a fee, such as "**Ethereum Gas Charges**", for the computational resources required to perform a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that the Company has no control over these fees, including: 

- (a) any Ethereum blockchain transactions;
- (b) the method of payment of any Ethereum Gas Charges; or 
- (c) any actual payments of Ethereum Gas Charges.

Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of digital assets, such as Ether, stored at your Wallet to complete any transaction on the Ethereum blockchain network before initiating such transactions. You may be subject to additional fees and charges, including fees required to access certain smart contracts. You acknowledge that such fees may be adjusted from time to time by us or by other users who set the terms of their own smart contracts. If you do not agree with the fees charged for Network functionality, do not use or access the Network.

The use of certain smart contract functionality on the Network may require the purchase of Keep Digital Assets, the payment of fees or the posting of collateral in other types of Digital Assets as determined by the creator of such smart contract. You agree that any such fees or requirements are reasonable, and your use of the Network or any related smart contracts shall constitute your acceptance of such fees or requirements.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct through the Network, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amount of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless for your failure to pay any taxes, including any penalties, duties and interest, imposed by any governmental authority.

**Risks.** Use of the Network may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are a novel and relatively experimental technology. Their value, if any, can fluctuate with great volatility, and transactions conducted with Digital Assets are irreversible. The use of Digital Assets in decentralized finance is inherently risky, and you acknowledge and agree that you are accessing and using the Network at your own risk. The risk of loss due to market volatility and malfeasance by other users of the Network can be substantial. Digital Assets and smart contracts are typically described using extremely technical language that is difficult to understand and requires a deep knowledge of cryptography and computer science. Dapps made available on the Network may have inherent design flaws that have not been detected in testing or may not perform as expected in conjunction with third-party technology or high-volume use. You should carefully consider whether you have sufficient understanding of the technology before accessing or using the Network.

By accessing or using the Network, you hereby represent that you have the requisite knowledge and experience to evaluate the risk of the technology you are using and any transactions you undertake, and you accept the risk that the Network might not function as anticipated and that you might lose access to your Digital Assets temporarily or permanently. The Network encourages the creation of third-party Dapps and smart contract technology, but the availability of third-party Dapps and smart contract technology on the Network is not an endorsement by us of that technology. You acknowledge and agree that the Company is not a party to the smart contracts offered on the Network and that the contract counterparty to any smart contracts you enter will likely be unknown to you.

You acknowledge that the Network runs on top of the decentralized Ethereum blockchain and that we have no control over the availability of the Ethereum blockchain or the price of the Digital Asset, ETH. The Ethereum protocol is open source, and anyone can use, copy or make modifications to the protocol known as "**Forks**"which could materially affect the operation of the Ethereum blockchain and thus, the Network. In the event of a Fork, you acknowledge and agree that we may temporarily or permanently suspend our operations and that we bear no liability for losses resulting from a Fork in the Ethereum blockchain.

More specifically, if you are a user of any one of several smart contracts on the Network, you may be required to post collateral or pay a fee. You acknowledge that under certain circumstances, market fluctuation could require you to increase the amount of collateral required to fulfill your performance obligations under the smart contract or your collateral could diminish in value or be lost altogether. Under no circumstances will the operation of all or any portion of the Network be deemed to create a relationship that includes the provision or tendering of investment advice.

The Network may become the target of sophisticated hacking attempts, cyber attacks, dramatic fluctuations in use or other technical or operational challenges that could affect its availability or ability to function properly. You accept the risk of any delays or transaction failures resulting from such interference with the Network or any third-party services connected to or operating in conjunction with the Network including other operators of decentralized networks, platforms or Dapps. You further acknowledge that decentralized lending and borrowing protocols that ultimately allow the use of Digital Assets created on our platform have no legal obligation to provide software development to or maintain their protocols, and you should not expect that their services will continue or be available at any particular time. We are not responsible for the availability of or maintenance to lending or borrowing protocols that allow interaction, through smart contracts or otherwise, with the Keep Network or Keep Digital Assets.

You acknowledge that Company is a non-custodial provider of Network services. We do not provide custody services, control or manage your Digital Assets in any manner whatsoever. The Network exists in a decentralized environment through which functionality can be autonomously directly accessed by you without any involvement or actions by Company or any third-party. Use of the Network requires the use of ERC 20 compatible Wallet(s). It is your responsibility to maintain access to and the security of your Wallet. If you fail to secure your Wallet properly, you could lose access to the contents of your Wallet and you will no longer be able to access or use some Network features.

In many jurisdictions, the regulatory frameworks imposed by governmental authorities over the use and sale of cryptocurrencies or Digital Assets are uncertain. Changes in regulations and policies may affect your use of the Network in your jurisdiction, and you are responsible for consulting with legal counsel and complying with all applicable laws in your jurisdiction.

The Network may rely on the use of third-party platforms, exchanges, Dapps, oracles or other mechanisms to facilitate your use of the Network. We do not control the availability of those platforms, and your access to and use of the Network could be affected by changes in those platforms which are beyond our control.
